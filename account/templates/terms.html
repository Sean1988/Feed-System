APP UPRISING WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OR INTERACTIONS WITH ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY INDIVIDUAL YOU MEET VIA THE SERVICE.<br><br>

APP UPRISING SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. FURTHER, APP UPRISING DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED. APP UPRISING DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF OTHER MEMBERS OR USERS (INCLUDING UNAUTHORIZED USERS), WHETHER SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS OCCUR DURING THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE<br><br>

d.  ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH MAY VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR LIMITATIONS ON OR EXCLUSIONS OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE DEPENDING ON HER, HIS, OR ITS STATE OF RESIDENCE.  <br><br>

e.  International Use. The Web Site and Services are controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. App Uprising makes no representations that the Web Site and Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Web Site and Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with local law, including but not limited to export and import regulations.  <br><br>

15. Force Majeure. App Uprising will not be liable for failing to perform under this TOS by the occurrence of any event beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, a labor disturbance, an Internet outage or interruption of service, a communications outage, failure by a service provider to App Uprising to perform, fire, terrorism, natural disaster or war. <br><br>

16. Disputes. In light of App Uprising’s substantial contacts with the State of New York, and your and our interests in ensuring that disputes regarding the interpretation, validity and enforceability of the TOS are resolved on a uniform basis, and App Uprising’s execution of, and the making of, the TOS in New York, you agree that: (i) any claim, cause of action or dispute you have with App Uprising and any litigation involving any noncompliance with or breach of the TOS, or regarding the interpretation, validity and/or enforceability of the TOS, must be filed and exclusively conducted in the state or federal courts in New York County, New York; and (ii) the Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard for any conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in New York County, New York for these purposes. Any claim or dispute between you and App Uprising that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York City, New York, unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph.<br><br>

For any claim (excluding claims for violations of confidentiality, intellectual property, rights of publicity and privacy, or otherwise claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $5,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>

17. Limitation of Actions. You acknowledge and agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, relating to, or connected with your use of the Web Site or Services, must be filed within one calendar year after such claim or cause of action arises, or forever be barred.<br><br>

18. Changes to the Web Site or Service. App Uprising may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, suspend, make improvements to or discontinue any aspect of the Web Site or the Services, temporarily or permanently, at any time without notice to you, and App Uprising will not be liable for doing so. <br><br> 

19. Termination. App Uprising will have the right in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason at all, without notice or liability to you or any third party, to terminate your access to the Web Site or Services, with or without cause. Such reasons may include, without limitation: (i) your breach of any part of this TOS, or (ii) your violation of the rights of any third party.<br><br>

20. Notices and Electronic Communications. All notices required by or permitted to be given under this TOS will be in writing and delivered to the other party by any of the following methods:  (i) hand delivery, (ii) certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (iii) overnight courier, or (iv) electronic mail. If you give notice to App Uprising, you must use the address shown on the Web Site. If App Uprising provides notice to you, App Uprising must use the contact information provided by you to App Uprising. All notices will be deemed received as follows: (i) if by hand-delivery, on the date of delivery, (ii) if delivery by U.S. Mail, on the date of receipt appearing on a return receipt card, (iii) if by overnight courier, on the date receipt is confirmed by such courier service, or (iv) if by electronic mail, 24 hours after the message was sent, if no “system error” or other notice of non-delivery is generated. Each party agrees that any notice that it receives from the other party electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.  <br><br>

21. Additional Terms. This TOS contains the entire understanding of you and App Uprising regarding the use of the Web Site and Services, whether oral or written, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between you and App Uprising regarding its subject matter. This TOS will be binding upon each party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns, and governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to conflict of law principles. This TOS and all of your rights and obligations under them (including, without limitation, your membership, if any) will not be assignable or transferable by you without the prior written consent of App Uprising. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this TOS will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege under this TOS. You and App Uprising are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this TOS. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this TOS will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this TOS, all of which will remain in full force and effect. App Uprising's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision. In such case, as referenced above, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. <br><br>
